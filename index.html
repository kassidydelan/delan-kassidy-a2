            <p class="quote"> "As many psychology studies attest, self-love and -compassion are key for mental health and well-being, keeping depression and anxiety at bay. Below, we take a look at some of the things that you can do to nurture this core feeling." </p>
            <h2>Why is Self-love important?</h2>
            <p class="motive">Self-love is something everyone should be encouraged to do for themselves because it's a way of accepting who you are as a person and realizing how beautiful you are, inside and out. Many of us feel insecure especially with social media revolving around our whole social life and having a standard on the way we look. Understanding the beauty we have with ourselves gives us the confidence to be happy in our own body and accepting the flaws we might have. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"self-kindness (i.e., treating oneself with understanding and forgiveness)"</li>
                    <li>"recognition of one's place in shared humanity (i.e., acknowledgment that people are not perfect and that personal experiences are part of the larger human experience)"</li>
                    <li>"and mindfulness (i.e., emotional equanimity and avoidance of overidentification with painful emotions)."</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Just a little reminder</h3>
            <p class="ending"><strong>YOU,</strong> are beautiful no matter what. Accepting your flaws is probably the hardest thing to do, but realizing your true beauty and worth will truly be worth it. You can do whatever your heart desires, you are unique in your own way and there's no one in this world just like you. Remember that! </p>
